## DYTE PROBLEM STATEMENT - Frontend (React)

Check out the editor [here](https://github.com/ngmars/React_code_editor/edit/main/README.md).

## There are 3 sections:

### File Explorer Pane
 - Contains 3 files: index.html, index.css, index.js.
 - Clicking on a file from the “file explorer” should display the corresponding content on the code editor for editing.

### Code editor
-  A “code editor” that supports syntax highlighting for HTML, CSS, and JS.

### Live view section
 - A “live view” section to show the rendered HTML website.
 - The “live view” section must display the rendered website that was created by the user. When a change is made to any of the index.html, index.css, or index.js files, the “live view” section should hot-reload, and display the new output.



### Bonus
- Feature to save your code, and generate a shareable link that should show the saved code when the link is visited. 
- Pastebin Developer API to save code, generate a unique link, and then load it back at a later stage.
- Deploy website on Github pages.
- React application using Typescript.
